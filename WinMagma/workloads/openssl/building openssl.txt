Native builds using Visual C++
==============================

The native builds using Visual C++ have a VC-* prefix.

Requirement details
-------------------

Prerequisites
=============

To install OpenSSL, you will need:

 * A "make" implementation
 * Perl 5 with core modules (please read [NOTES-PERL.md](NOTES-PERL.md))
 * The Perl module `Text::Template` (please read [NOTES-PERL.md](NOTES-PERL.md))
 * an ANSI C compiler
 * a development environment in the form of development libraries and C
   header files
 * a supported operating system


In addition to the requirements and instructions listed in INSTALL.md,
these are required as well:

### Perl

We recommend Strawberry Perl, available from <http://strawberryperl.com/>
Please read NOTES.PERL for more information, including the use of CPAN.
An alternative is ActiveState Perl, <https://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl>
for which you may need to explicitly build the Perl module Win32/Console.pm
via <https://platform.activestate.com/ActiveState> and then download it.

### Microsoft Visual C compiler.

Since these are proprietary and ever-changing we cannot test them all.
Older versions may not work. Use a recent version wherever possible.

### Netwide Assembler (NASM)

NASM is the only supported assembler. It is available from <https://www.nasm.us>.

Quick start
-----------

 1. Install Perl

 2. Install NASM

 3. Make sure both Perl and NASM are on your %PATH%

 4. Use Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt with administrative privileges,
    choosing one of its variants depending on the intended architecture.
    Or run "cmd" and execute "vcvarsall.bat" with one of the options x86,
    x86_amd64, x86_arm, x86_arm64, amd64, amd64_x86, amd64_arm, or amd64_arm64.
    This sets up the environment variables needed for nmake.exe, cl.exe, etc.

    <https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line>

 5. From the root of the OpenSSL source directory enter
    perl Configure VC-WIN32    if you want 32-bit OpenSSL or
    perl Configure VC-WIN64A   if you want 64-bit OpenSSL or
    perl Configure             to let Configure figure out the platform

 6. nmake

 7. nmake test

 8. nmake install

For the full installation instructions, or if anything goes wrong at any stage,
check the INSTALL.md file.

Installation directories
------------------------

The default installation directories are derived from environment
variables.

For VC-WIN32, the following defaults are use:

    PREFIX:      %ProgramFiles(x86)%\OpenSSL
    OPENSSLDIR:  %CommonProgramFiles(x86)%\SSL

For VC-WIN64, the following defaults are use:

    PREFIX:      %ProgramW6432%\OpenSSL
    OPENSSLDIR:  %CommonProgramW6432%\SSL

Should those environment variables not exist (on a pure Win32
installation for examples), these fallbacks are used:

    PREFIX:      %ProgramFiles%\OpenSSL
    OPENSSLDIR:  %CommonProgramFiles%\SSL

ALSO NOTE that those directories are usually write protected, even if
your account is in the Administrators group.  To work around that,
start the command prompt by right-clicking on it and choosing "Run as
Administrator" before running 'nmake install'.  The other solution
is, of course, to choose a different set of directories by using
--prefix and --openssldir when configuring.
